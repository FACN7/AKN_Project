# AKN_Project
## Ariel, Karem and Natalia first project

### why?
We were tasked to create a simple single page website about our team.
We need this practice in order to enrich our knowledge in web development in its basic concepts.
And ofcourse because we are the **best team!**

### what?
Our website is mobile friendly and fully responsive and it also fits for disabled people
passing all off the tests using 'Lighthouse'.
We have a Navigation bar to easily navigate throgh the site.
You can enter each members "Linkdin" , "Github" and "Codewars" personal accounts as well.
There is a simple 'Contact Us' form in the page (currently with no DB connection).
The site will work the same way for users who have 'javascript' disabled in their browsers.

### how?
Ariel was incharged of writing the readme file and creating the form in the page.
Natalia was incharged of the navigation bar and the main area.
Karem was incharged of the "cards" section with the personnel links and info.
all of us worked together on designing the website and to make it fully responsive.
we created issues and resolved them using commits and pull requests all the time.
There were a times when we encountered problems with conflicts but with the help of
our mentors we managed to resolve them.

### Our stretch goals
 1. Create a fully responsive Hamburger in the navigation bar.
 2. Take a nicer photos of ourselves ;)
 3. Create a professional logo.
 4. Create a DB so users can actually contact us and send us messages.
